Design a premium, minimalist luxury jewelry website for a brand named SVARNIKAA.

The brand identity must feel elegant, timeless, and high-end, inspired by Indian heritage with a modern global luxury aesthetic.

Color Palette:

Primary background color: soft buff / warm beige

Secondary background: pure white for breathing space

Accent & content highlights: metallic gold (used only for headings, borders, icons, and key emphasis)

Text color: deep charcoal or warm dark brown (never pure black)

Typography:

Brand name “SVARNIKAA” placed at the top center in elegant serif typography with subtle gold finish

Headings: luxury serif font

Body text: clean, minimal sans-serif

Layout Style:

Clean, spacious, editorial luxury layout

No clutter, no heavy navigation

High white space and balanced symmetry

Premium fashion-magazine style composition

Header:

Center-aligned brand logo text “SVARNIKAA”

Minimal right-side icons only (wishlist, enquiry, cart placeholder)

No category menu

Hero Section:

Full-width hero image of premium gold jewelry on a soft neutral background

Subtle warm lighting

Tagline example: “Crafted in Gold. Curated with Grace.”

Single primary CTA button: “View Collection” in gold accent

Main Content Section – Available Stock:

Display jewelry as a clean grid of product cards

Each card includes:

High-quality jewelry image

Product name

Minimal metadata (metal type or weight)

“Enquire” button instead of Buy Now

No categories, no filters, no prices

Layout must feel like a curated collection, not an e-commerce catalog

Feature Highlights Section:

Three minimal feature blocks with gold line icons

Text examples:

Hallmark Certified

Ethically Sourced

Handcrafted Excellence

White background with gold accents

Editorial Brand Section:

Large image + elegant text block

Emotional brand statement emphasizing craftsmanship, elegance, and exclusivity

Footer:

Minimal and clean

Brand name, contact info, social icons, and legal links

No visual noise

Important Functional Concept (Design-Aware):

Website is inventory-driven, not category-driven

Design should support future JSON/API-based content updates

Product cards should appear modular and repeatable

Overall Mood:

Luxury

Calm

Trust-building

Premium jewelry boutique feel

Export-ready global brand aesthetic

Avoid loud colors, avoid over-decoration, avoid trendy UI gimmicks.
The design should feel timeless, elegant, and authoritative.
